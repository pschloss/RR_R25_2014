The proposed research is relevant to public health because it supports
researchers within the domain of microbiome research, who have shown that it is
impossible to separate human health from the structure and function of the human
microbiome. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NIHâ€™s mission that
pertains to the development, maintenance, and renewal of scientific resources
that will assure our ability to perform robust and reproducible research in
order to prevent disease.
