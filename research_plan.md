## Approach





The NIH Research Education Program (R25) supports research educational
activities that complement other formal training programs in the mission areas
of the NIH Institutes and Centers. The over-arching goals of the NIH R25 program
are to: (1) complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the
nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs; (2) enhance the
diversity of the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce; (3)
help recruit individuals with specific specialty or disciplinary backgrounds to
research careers in biomedical, behavioral and clinical sciences; and (4) foster
a better understanding of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research and its
implications.

The over-arching goal of this  NIH  R25 program is to support educational
activities that     complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to
meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs and foster
a better understanding of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research and its
implications.  To accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this FOA will support
creative educational activities with a primary focus on:


Courses for Skills Development: Specifically, exportable training modules
designed to enhance data reproducibility, targeted to graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and beginning investigators.



Graduate students were often **significantly dependent on the mentor or the
mentor's lab for the training received, and postdoctoral fellows were primarily
dependent on the mentor or mentor's lab at all institutions**.  Rather than
being learned in prescribed curricula, **training in good laboratory practices
that influence data reproducibility appears to be largely passed down from
generation to generation of working scientists**, with substantial variation
from laboratory to laboratory.  Importantly, most respondents thought an NIGMS
program aimed at producing exportable training modules would be beneficial.  It
is also hoped that NIH involvement in promoting training in this area will raise
the visibility of this issue and its importance within our grantee community.


The target audiences for these modules are graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, and beginning investigators.  It is expected that the proposed training
modules will identify deficiencies and teach best laboratory practices in one or
more of the following four general areas:

* Analysis and reporting: what are the necessary procedural details that should
be included; what are the research resources that must be identified, including
their type and source

* Culture of science: how to ensure adequate oversight when the volume and speed
of new science may mean mentors are unfamiliar with technology used by their
trainees.



Research Strategy

The Research Strategy section must be used to upload the Research Education
Program Plan, which must include the following components described below:

* Proposed Research Education Program
* Program Director/Principal Investigator
* Program Faculty
* Institutional Environment and Commitment
* Evaluation Plan
* Dissemination Plan

Proposed Research Education Program. While the proposed research education
program may complement ongoing research training and education occurring at the
applicant institution, the proposed educational experiences must be distinct
from those research training and research education programs currently receiving
federal support. When research training programs are on-going in the same
department, the applicant organization should clearly distinguish between the
activities in the proposed research education program and the research training
supported by the training program. The description should include the
educational and/or career level(s) of the planned participants. The research
education proposed must be targeted to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,
and beginning investigators

State the goals for education and justify the area of training selected for
module development in terms of its relevance and potential impact on improving
data reproducibility. Describe the subject material to be covered.  Describe the
format for the training module proposed and justify it in terms of the education
goals.  The length of the proposed training module should be explained in terms
of scope and depth of coverage of the subject matter and how the research
education will be utilized by trainees, for example, a module on how to avoid
confirmation bias to be taken by all beginning laboratory workers at the
graduate student, postdoctoral fellow and beginning investigator level, or a
module on appropriate design of animal studies to be taken immediately prior to
beginning such work. Describe the plans for piloting the training module.

Describe plans for making the proposed training module section 508 compliant of
the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. '794 d), as amended by the Workforce
Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105 – 220; see http://www.section508.gov/ for
additional information).

Provide a timeline for module development, piloting and refinement,
dissemination, evaluation, and maintenance.  This timeline must propose making
the training publically available within two years of the award date

Program Director/Principal Investigator. Describe arrangements for
administration of the program.  Provide evidence that the Program
Director/Principal Investigator is actively engaged in research and/or teaching
in an area related to the mission of NIH, and can organize, administer, monitor,
and evaluate the research education program. For programs proposing multiple
PDs/PIs, describe the complementary and integrated expertise of the PDs/PIs;
their leadership approach, and governance appropriate for the planned project.

Program Faculty. Researchers from diverse backgrounds, including racial and
ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, and women are encouraged to
participate as program faculty. Faculty should have research expertise and
experience relevant to the proposed program and demonstrate a history of, or the
potential for, their intended roles.

Program Participants. Applications must describe the intended participants, and
the eligibility criteria and/or specific educational background characteristics
that are essential for participation in the proposed research education program.
Identify the career levels  for which the proposed program is planned. The
training proposed must be targeted to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,
and/or beginning investigators

Institutional Environment and Commitment. Describe the institutional
environment, reiterating the availability of facilities and educational
resources (described separately under “Facilities & Other Resources”), that can
contribute to the planned Research Education Program. Evidence of institutional
commitment to the research educational program is required. A letter of
institutional commitment must be attached as part of Letters of Support (see
below). Appropriate institutional commitment should include the provision of
adequate staff, facilities, and educational resources that can contribute to the
planned research education program.

Evaluation Plan. Applications must include a plan for evaluating the activities
supported by the award in terms of their frequency of use and their usefulness.
The application must specify baseline metrics (e.g., numbers, educational
levels, and demographic characteristics of participants), as well as measures to
gauge the short or long-term success of the research education award in
achieving its objectives. Wherever appropriate, applicants are encouraged to
obtain feedback from participants to help identify weaknesses and to provide
suggestions for improvements.

Dissemination Plan. A specific plan must be provided to disseminate nationally at
no additional cost the finished training modules.

A letter of institutional commitment must be attached as part of Letters of
Support (see section above:”Institutional Environment and Commitment.”
