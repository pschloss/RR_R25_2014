### Objective
Create a module to teach individuals and research teams how to create
collaborative and reproducible computational research notebooks

---

### Aims
* Develop training materials that describe best practices in the use of
  electronic, reproducible, and collaborative computational notebooks
* Establish an evolving resource for describing tools and practices for
  further development of these materials and practices (e.g. make, authoring
  papers, etc)

---

### Problems with paper/pen notebooks
* Note useful to the researcher
* Not collaborative - live most of their lives in a file cabinet or a shelf
  - this would be very collaborative
  - permanence
* Difficult to index through
  - tags
  - search engine accessible
* Inefficient, difficult to incorporate multi-media
  - makes writing more efficient
  - multi-media very easy to incorporate
* Incomplete - large datasets impossible to tape into document
* Difficult to share with potential employers

---

### Problems with digital notebooks
* Learning curve - but people need to get over that in computational disciplines
* Privacy concerns
* Legal aspects
* Doodling - apps for that?
* Many ELN have proprietary formats

---

### Modules will provide
* instruction on the importance of computational notebooks
* templates for setting up and maintaining a blog-based notebook
* best practices for using version control software (e.g. git and GitHub)
* discussion of code review as an mechanism for mentor-mentee interaction
* best practices for using literate programming tools for fostering reproducible
  research

---

### Target enrollees
* students/postdocs/bioinformaticians - people doing the work (workers)
* collaborators (e.g. people supervising the work)

---

### Plan
* For each module, develop open source templates and example workflows
* Three levels of modules
   - Cookbook w/ predefined project
   - Generic w/ predefined project
   - Generic w/ their project

---

### Modules
1. Importance of RR and the value of a laboratory notebook towards that goal
  - case studies
  - discussion items
1. Development of electronic notebook using a blog
  - markdown
  - knitr
1. Maintaining blog and documentation using git and GitHub
  - version control
  - case studies w/ varying levels of documentation
1. How to collaborate
  - pull requests
  - code review
  - blog comments
1. Licensing
  - privacy
  - open science
1. Advanced topics
  - publishing
  - LaTex
  - slidify

---

### Evaluation
* Macro
  - Pre-module questionnaire
  - Do they make it through the module?
  - Can set up working environment?
  - Can they replicate mock project when spoon-fed instructions?
  - Do the participants continue to adopt the method at 3, 6, and 12 months?
  - Are literate programming tools used to write/disseminated with papers?
  - Is their work actually more reproducible?
* Micro
  - Statistics on commit history
  - Quality of commit messages
  - Number of pull requests
  - Number of comments on blogs
  - Frequency of blog postings
* Mechanics
  - Have them make us collaborator on GitHub repositories
  - Give them a script to run that pulls out all of the information
  - Embed actions within modules' website and scrape information from there
